# Movie Search App

This application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This application helps users search for movies using the [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.

* Future improvements: Unit tests, UI improvements, SASS vars, pagination component, search input component, etc.
